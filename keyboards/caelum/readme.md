# README

Forked from an ergonomic, split, concave keyboard, with convex thumb pads, Lagrange. See the [project page](https://github.com/dpapavas/lagrange-keyboard) for more info.

* Keyboard Maintainer: [my99n](https://github.com/vzsky)
* Hardware: Handwired as per the guide

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make handwired/caelum:default

To program the keyboard you'll need to reset it.  This can be accomplished, either through the reset button, accessible via a hole in the bottom cover, or, if you've assigned the `QK_BOOT` keycode to a key, by pressing that key.

See the [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_build_tools) and the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/getting_started_make_guide) for more information. Brand new to QMK? Start with our [Complete Newbs Guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs).
